# quantum


Created a mini walkthough games for kids to better understand quantum computing. 

In this experiment you will be walked through concepts in both classical and quantum computing. By the end you should understand why the behavior of qubits has been called "spooky" by the likes of Albert Einstein. You will be guided through an explanation of classical and quantum computing as well as the creation of a simple quantum circuit that produces examples of superposition and entanglement. 
Some concepts covered are: 
- Logical AND Gate
- Logical OR Gate
- Qubits
- Hadamard Gate
- CNOT Gate
